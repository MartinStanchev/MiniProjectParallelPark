# MiniProjectParallelPark

Parallel parking arduino sketch:<br>
smartCar.ino inside the ArduinoSketches folder is the MAIN car parking sketch that we use. As you can see it should be the one latest to be pushed to. All the other sketches you can see here are sketches we used to work on, but then for some reason left behind.
<br>
<br>
Object detection arudino sketch:<br>
smartCar.ino also contains the Arduino code needed to make the car respond to camera output through the serial. So for both parallel parking and object detection you can load the "smartCar.ino" sketch onto the Arduino to be able to use.
<br>
<br>
Object detection python file:<br>
detectTrafficLight.py in the folder "PiTrafficLight" is the main object detection python file in use. This file should be available and run from the Raspberry Pi computer connected to the Arduino.
(update when name has been set and its been uploaded to master branch in the correct folder)
